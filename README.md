# KEARL for EEDFJSP Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the paper: **"A knowledge-guided evolutionary algorithm incorporating reinforcement learning for energy efficient dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem with machine breakdowns"**.

## 🚀 How to use

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the algorithm.

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the code to your local machine and navigate into the directory:

git clone [https://github.com/imvietcuongfrvietnam/KEARL4EEDFJSP.git](https://github.com/imvietcuongfrvietnam/KEARL4EEDFJSP.git)

cd KEARL4EEDFJSP

### 2. Install Miniconda

If you haven't installed Conda yet, download and install Miniconda here: 

https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install

### 3. Create a new environment

Create a virtual environment (we recommend using Python 3.8 or higher):

conda create -n kearl4eedfjsp python=3.9

### 4. Activate the environment

Activate the newly created environment:

conda activate kearl4eedfjsp

### 5. Install dependencies

Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 6. Run the code:

Start the algorithm by running the main script:

python main.py
